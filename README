                            Unnamed BMB-497F Project

These are the release notes for an unnamed BMB 497F project.  The project will
most likely cover DeBruijn graph representations for certain repeat families in
the human genome.

  Beyond the fact that the project will have something to do with DeBruijn
  graphs, the project scope has yet to be determined.
